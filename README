Elpoint -- Yet Another Presentation Tool on Emacsen

Elpoint is a presentation tool which runs on Emacs.
Currently, it works only on Emacs 21.

Features:

* Easy to create and display a presentation.
* Dynamic presentation content can be developed using emacs lisp.
* A major mode `ept-mode' is included which supports editing elpoint
  presentation.
* Inline images. Images can be retrieved from Internet.
* Create a presentation from outline-mode text.

Requirements:

* Emacs 21
* APEL
* True Type font (Kochi font is recommended)
  You can obtain kochi font from following site:

    http://www.on.cs.keio.ac.jp/~yasu/jp_fonts.html

  If you use `fonts.dir.xtt' included in the package (*1),
  emacs font setting for Elpoint is easy.

Install:

* Extract tarball.
* Type `make install'.

Usage:

Add following line to your .emacs.

(require 'ept-setup)

If you installed kochi font using above (*1) setting, font setup is also done
by above.

If you want to use a font other than kochi font, add following lines to your
.emacs

(setq ept-use-kochi nil)
(require 'ept-setup)

and add your own font setting like ept-kochi-x.el.

Since ept-setup is just a sample setting, you can setup Elpoint
without ept-setup.

Basically, presentations are written by emacs lisp.
If you  C-x C-f (find-file) a file with '.ept' suffix ,
the buffer becomes `ept-mode' (which is derived from emacs-lisp-mode).

See the sample presentations to know the presentation syntax of Elpoint.

There are some sample presentation files in the samples/ directory
of the package. See samples/README for more detail.
